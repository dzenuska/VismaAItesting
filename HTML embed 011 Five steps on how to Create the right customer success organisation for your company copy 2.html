<p>Step 1: Questions to review before changing the organization</p>

<p>What do you expect to gain from introducing Customer Success in your organization? What will be their areas of responsibility? What are your short-term and long-term goals for Customer Success? Where will Customer Success sit in your organization? What will be their tasks, especially compared to other existing teams? How will you assess the contribution of the Customer Success function? How will you fund your new Customer Success team? What tools, systems, and processes will need to be changed/implemented? How will you explain the Customer Success function to the organization? How will you introduce the Customer Success function to your customers? Step 2: Finding the right organizational model Please refer to this article in Visma Space from January 2023, outlining how to approach this difficult decision. Here is a summary, breaking the decision down into the below specific aspects in B2B companies:</p>

<p>A) Your company's culture</p>

<p>For flat organizations and self-managing roles, consider a CS leader without direct reports, allowing the existing roles to fully understand the role of CS. For hierarchical organizations, typically, a CS leader will need to have influence on multiple parts of the organization to reach the Customer Success objectives (achieved through common CS-related goals or making the leader responsible for certain functions). B) Type of your customers</p>

<p>Small &amp; Medium businesses: Scalability is crucial. A CS leader often manages a team responsible for training, digital learning, and analytics. Medium &amp; Large businesses: Consider providing the CS leader with responsibility for all roles that interact with your customers. Public companies: The CS leader may need to be in charge of Marketing and Sales processes. C) The reason you want to build or upgrade your Customer Success function right now</p>

<p>Customers don't get what they are promised: Task the CS leader with implementing the 1st rule of CS: Sell to the right customer. Cooperation and common objectives with Marketing &amp; Sales are crucial. Customers don't achieve the objective they looked for: For MLE/Public segment, consider a CS leader with a team of Customer Success Managers. In SMB, consider a CS leader as a cross-functional project manager, driving self-service and digital learning improvements for customers. Poor product quality (incidents, etc.): Consider a CS leader managing consultancy or support teams and helping Product teams. Onboarding challenges: Consider a CS leader with consultancy and support teams to lean on. Lead generation: A CS leader with responsibility for CX analytics (surveys, product analytics, Voice of the Customer). Recommendation-based sales: CS function could drive the process of identifying and attracting advocates among your customers. Increase upsell/cross-sell with existing customers: In MLE/Public, a CS leader with Customer Success Managers can offer existing customers solutions that resolve their expected business outcomes. In SMB, often integrating CS with Sales and Marketing can do the trick in changing the perspective to the upsell/cross-sell methods. Product adoption: In MLE/Public segment, give the CS leader full responsibility for all customer-facing roles (complex products, large customers). In SMB, give the CS leader responsibility for the onboarding process and digital communication. D) Complexity of your product</p>

<p>Simple, quick-to-onboard products: Customer Success may need to focus more on working with Product teams to define customer needs and product vision. Complex products: The CS leader's time may go into improving customer onboarding (shortening the time to value) and user competence. In this setup, consultancy and support teams often report to the CS leader. Step 3: Establishing a leadership role Three characteristics that the Customer Success leader role needs to have:</p>

<p>&quot;A seat at the table&quot;: Being part of the Business Unit's management team will ensure that customer experience is discussed on the executive level, and actions are aligned and prioritized across the organization. The right performance indicators and goals: Such as being responsible for revenue and profitability. That will move the focus from just making customers happy to more long-term improvements that drive sustainable growth of the company. A team to lean on: The leader needs a team that reports directly or has a mandate for a dotted line as a minimum and can support the efforts to drive customer success and improve experience. Step 4: Customer Success management Depending on the type of your customers, your products, etc. (see Step 2 above), you may need to establish who is going to be responsible for the well-being of and communication with individual customers - even if only the biggest, most valuable customers. In such a case, it's the Customer Success Manager (CSM) role that typically drives customer retention, loyalty &amp; business growth by ensuring the customers achieve their goals and are satisfied with the solution &amp; services. If you will have CSMs, then most likely they will report to the Customer Success leader.</p>

<p>Step 5: Define the roles (and hire if necessary)</p>
