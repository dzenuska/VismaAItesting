<p>To stay competitive in today's market, we need to create a customer-centric organization by constantly adjusting and updating our products and services to match customer requirements and meet their needs.</p>

<p>Visma's strategy is to focus on 4 areas to deliver a world-class customer experience: products, relationships with customers, the quality of our services, and keeping our customers close and successful.</p>

<p>Since &quot;you can improve only what you measure,&quot; these are the 4 main metrics of customer experience in Visma:</p>

<p>Product Net Promoter Score (pNPS): This metric helps improve our products by creating a feedback loop between the customer and the product development team, driving a customer-centric approach. Applicable to all segments, our goals for 2023 are as follows: No products under -20 pNPS, and all strategic products with pNPS > 25. For products with pNPS below -25, the annual increase should be 10 points per year.</p>

<p>Relational Net Promoter Score (rNPS): This metric focuses on improving our relationships with customers. It is applicable to segments such as Upper SMB, Large Private &amp; Public. Our target is to achieve a Last Twelve Months (LTM) rNPS score of > 25, indicating high customer loyalty and their willingness to promote us as a supplier.</p>

<p>Support Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): This metric measures how well we deliver customer support services, reflecting our competence and care towards our customers. It is applicable to all segments, and our target is to have 80% of customers satisfied with our support.</p>

<p>Net Revenue Retention (NRR): This metric measures our ability to keep existing customers and grow revenue from them. The aggregated Visma Group Net Retention Rate (NRR) target is > 105%. Additionally, there are segment-specific NRR targets: Small Businesses: 103%, MLE: 105%, Public: 108%.</p>

<p>By systematically collecting customer feedback using these metrics, we gain valuable information that helps us improve our products and services.</p>
