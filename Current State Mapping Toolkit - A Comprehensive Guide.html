</head>
<body>

<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Current state mapping is a crucial process for understanding the existing challenges, customer experiences, and internal operations within an organization. By mapping the current state, companies can identify pain points, prioritize improvements, and enhance the overall customer journey. This article presents a comprehensive toolkit that provides step-by-step guidance and templates for conducting a successful current state mapping project. It emphasizes the importance of adapting the toolkit to meet the unique needs and goals of each company.</p>

<p>Considerations</p>

<p>Before diving into the mapping process, it is essential to consider the following factors:</p>

<p>Identify the Challenges: Determine the specific challenges your company faces, such as high customer churn or dissatisfaction, to gain a clear understanding of the areas that require improvement.</p>

<p>Review Insights and Data: Collect and analyze available insights and data to support your assumptions and provide a solid foundation for the mapping project.</p>

<p>Choose the Perspective: Decide whether you want to focus on mapping the current state or envisioning the future state based on the insights gained. This decision will shape the direction of the mapping project.</p>

<p>Step 1: Scope and Stakeholder Identification</p>

<p>The initial step involves defining the scope of the project, including the customer segment and product to be analyzed. Additionally, identify the internal stakeholders who should actively participate in the project and those who need to be informed about its progress.</p>

<p>Step 2: Management Buy-in and Alignment</p>

<p>Securing management buy-in is crucial for the success of the mapping project. Ensure that top-level management supports and commits to the project. Align the project goals with the company's overall strategy and ensure the availability of necessary resources throughout the project's duration.</p>

<p>Step 3: Project Timing and Related Projects</p>

<p>Agree on the optimal timing for running the project, considering the availability of key resources within the organization. It is also important to investigate any related projects that may impact the current state mapping.</p>

<p>Step 4: Current State Mapping Preparation</p>

<p>Before commencing the mapping process, make necessary preparations by:</p>

<p>Agreeing on the project's scope, customer segment, and product focus. Identifying key stakeholders and gathering available insights. Establishing the timing and related activities for the mapping project. As-Is Mapping</p>

<p>The as-is mapping phase involves conducting interviews with customers to understand their perspective on the current journey. Summarize the findings from these interviews and align them with the results of the current state mapping. Finally, present the findings to key stakeholders for their review and input.</p>

<p>Defining Actions</p>

<p>Based on the insights gained from the current state mapping, agree on actions to improve the customer experience. Prioritize these actions and identify potential business improvement projects that can address the identified challenges effectively.</p>

<p>Business Improvement Projects</p>

<p>Upon completing the mapping and identifying actions, initiate business improvement projects aligned with the mapping results. Seek guidance and expertise from relevant teams within the organization to ensure the successful execution of these projects.</p>

<p>Part 1: Scoping</p>

<p>In this section, practical information related to the project is discussed, including stakeholder involvement, project team/steering group, project ownership, allocated time, timeframe, and any related projects.</p>

<p>Project Outcome</p>

<p>Clearly define the desired outcome and deliverables of the project. Establish success criteria, identify potential risks, and assign responsibility for implementing the improvements.</p>

<p>Preparations</p>

<p>Ask relevant questions during the introduction meeting to gather essential information, tailor the project plan, and address specific project requirements.</p>

<p>Key Areas to Consider</p>

<p>Before starting the mapping process, consider gathering all available insights related to the chosen customer segment and product. This may include NPS scores, web statistics, and support issues. Additionally, conduct interviews with key stakeholders to understand the feedback received from customers regarding existing challenges.</p>

<p>Gather Insights</p>

<p>Set measurable KPIs for the project, both qualitative and quantitative, to track progress and evaluate the impact of improvements. Examples of suggested KPIs include NPS scores, onboarding time, customer churn rate, and response time to customers on all channels.</p>

<p>Part 2: Current State Mapping</p>

<p>This section focuses on mapping the current state by involving key stakeholders in workshops. The expected journey and actual customer journey should be mapped and validated with actual customers to identify gaps and pain points. Visualizing the customer journey and aligning it with internal organizational processes and systems provides a holistic view of the service and its connections.</p>

<p>Mapping the Internal Organization</p>

<p>Conduct workshops or interviews to map the internal organization's processes, systems, and teams involved at each stage of the customer journey. This mapping helps identify internal challenges that may contribute to customer pain points.</p>

<p>Template for Mapping</p>

<p>Use the provided template or tools like Mural to facilitate the mapping process and document the relationships between the customer journey and internal organization.</p>

<p>Part 3: Validate with Customers</p>

<p>Conduct interviews with 5-6 customers from the chosen customer segment to validate the expected journey. Focus on understanding their experiences and ask specific questions about the triggers, purchase process, onboarding, and overall journey. Update the journey based on customer feedback, identify pain points, and prioritize them according to severity and implementation effort.</p>

<p>Ideation</p>

<p>Hold workshops to generate ideas for improving the customer journey. Encourage participants to brainstorm and contribute ideas to address specific pain points. Cluster and sort the ideas, translating them into actionable steps with defined timelines and desired results.</p>

<p>Impact vs. Effort</p>

<p>Prioritize the identified actions by assessing their impact on customer satisfaction and the effort required for implementation. Use the impact vs. effort map as a visual tool to guide decision-making.</p>

<p>Part 4: Plan Improvements</p>

<p>Create an implementation plan for the improvements based on the prioritized actions. Assign owners to each action, define a timeline, and establish desired results. Continuously follow up on the progress of the improvements and measure their impact through appropriate KPIs. Incorporate customer feedback and iterate on the improvements to ensure long-term success.</p>

<p>Testing and Feedback Loop</p>

<p>Test the implemented improvements with customers to validate their effectiveness and gather feedback. Use this feedback to further refine and enhance the customer journey.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>The current state mapping toolkit presented in this article provides a structured approach to understanding and improving the customer journey. By following the outlined steps, organizations can identify pain points, prioritize improvements, and create a roadmap for enhancing the overall customer experience. Adapt the toolkit to your company's specific needs and goals to achieve maximum benefits from the mapping project.</p>
