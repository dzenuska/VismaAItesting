<p>Are you maximizing your growth? Customer Success Plan Framework.</p>

<p>A Customer Success plan is a subscription package with products &amp; services that the customer needs to achieve their desired business outcomes.</p>

<p>Four steps on how to create the right customer success plan for the right customer:</p>

<p>SELL THE PROBLEM YOU SOLVE NOT THE PRODUCT</p>

<p>Customers who reach their goals will stick with you and recommend you to others! A Customer Success plan is a subscription package with products &amp; services that the customer needs to achieve their business outcomes. Provide a great customer experience with a strategy to reach the outcomes the customer expects from using your product. Plan the tasks, resources, and recurring revenue with a subscription package of products and services that meet the needs of the customer. Customers who reach their goals will stick with you and recommend you to others, driving your success in the subscription economy.</p>

<p>Why make a Customer Success plan? Strategy to reach the outcomes customer expects. Provide a great customer experience. Plan internal tasks and resources. Increase recurring revenue. This combination of product features and services is called a success plan. Since it is a subscription package with a long-term commitment between you and the customer, it becomes a strategy to reach the outcomes the customer expects while receiving a great customer experience. You will know what is required from your business so you can better plan internal tasks and resources.</p>

<p>Customers who reach their goals are more likely to stick with you and recommend you to others, ultimately allowing you to succeed in the subscription economy. Visma companies that have introduced Customer Success Plans experience an annual recurring revenue increase between 20-30%.</p>

<p>Combine standardized elements (services, product features, activities, etc.) into a matching solution that brings recurring revenue.</p>

<p>How to create the right solution for the right customer? What does this customer need to solve their problem?</p>

<p>Reporting revenue from recurring support services: Visma has a special revenue class for recurring support services paid as a subscription: &quot;Premium support &amp; managed services&quot;.</p>

<p>One-off support and consulting are kept separate and do not contribute to recurring revenue.</p>

<p>NB: We recommend collecting advance payments from customers to increase Cash conversion!</p>
