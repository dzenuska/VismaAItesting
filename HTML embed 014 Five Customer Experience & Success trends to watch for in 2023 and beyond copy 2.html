<p>As a recession looms, Customer Experience (CX) and Customer Success (CS) are more important now than ever to stay ahead of the competition. In order to do that, it helps to be aware of the latest trends in CX and CS.</p>

<p>We have highlighted the top trends to watch for in 2023 and beyond, along with our recommendations on steps you can take to bring your game to the next level.</p>

<p>Trend #1: Designing great CX is getting easier with the rise of data analytics &quot;By 2025, 60% of organizations will adopt analytics technology to supplement traditional surveys by analyzing voice and text interactions with customers.&quot; (Gartner, Feb 2022)</p>

<p>With the rise of data analytics, companies can get a more comprehensive and granular view of their customers' journeys when using their products, connect more closely with them, learn their behaviors, and identify CX issues and opportunities in real-time.</p>

<p>Trend #2: Using &quot;Aha!&quot; moments to drive engagement and retention Now, from users' behaviors to emotions. There's joy in discovery, at that moment when you understand how something works:</p>

<p>&quot;Aha! Now I understand it, this is brilliant! How could I live without this before?&quot;</p>

<p>The same thing happens to our users when they discover your product's usefulness. It's called the Aha! moment. It is an emotional response, yet it can be identified, measured, and tracked. It is possible to spot patterns or themes among successful or super users vs those who are inactive or struggling and predict when other users might encounter the Aha! moments and guide them so that they reach those moments. By knowing your users' Aha moments, you can reinforce their behavior, product adoption, feature discovery, and enhance long-term retention.</p>

<p>Trend #3: Switching from a high-touch to a tech-touch approach, without leaving out the human connection &quot;In 2023, self-service options will soar and expand to short videos and voice messages to allow customers to solve problems and find answers on their own time.&quot; (Forbes, Dec 2022)</p>

<p>As companies are pressured to reduce costs, they have a constant desire to scale the operations. They want to sell more, onboard customers faster, cut down on support time. This is why we need to review our customer journeys and identify tasks that can be automated so employees only intervene when needed and can offer personalized support and advice as well as quality self-help, like Knowledge Base, FAQ, Community.</p>

<p>Trend #4: Finding the critical moments in the employee experience journey &quot;Employees at leading EX companies are more inclined to surpass work expectations, having a 40 percent higher level of discretionary effort.&quot; (McKinsey, 2021) Employee Experience (EX) means pinpointing important moments in an employee's journey and making them more positive, fulfilling, even joyful. This, in turn, will allow your teams to be more efficient and positive towards your customers (read: improve CX)! Understanding what is important to employees and what the critical moments are to maximize satisfaction, performance, and productivity is key to keep employees engaged.</p>

<p>Trend #5: Businesses will invest more in customer success if they can quantify the returns generated by customer success During recent years the world has been facing a recession, inflation, with companies trying to cut costs, often at the expense of the Customer Success budget. However, when Gainsight interviewed SaaS CEOs and investors for their SaaS Market Research and asked where they think SaaS companies should decrease spending, both CEOs and investors agreed that Customer Success should be the least likely to receive departmental cuts. With this in mind, how can you measure the return generated by your Customer Success function and show the management that it is a value center, not a cost center?</p>
