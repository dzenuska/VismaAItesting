<p>Getting Started with rNPS</p>

<p>To get started with relational NPS (rNPS) in your business unit, contact J&#363;lija Kirillova &amp; Edgars Dzenu&#353;ka who will lead you through the onboarding. These are the overall steps that are necessary to get started with rNPS:</p>

<p>Top management commitment and endorsement: It is important to have top management involved in the NPS process. The onboarding starts with a meeting involving top management to frame the goals and responsibilities around NPS.</p>

<p>Appoint roles: Two roles related to working with rNPS in Visma are NPS Manager and Data Steward. These roles are appointed after the initial meeting.</p>

<p>Organize and upload data: Data organization and uploading process is required. More information about this process can be found in the provided Google Sheet.</p>

<p>Set up company hierarchy: You can set up a hierarchy that reflects your internal company structure. This enables filtering in reporting based on the hierarchy. It can be based on departments or responsibility areas.</p>

<p>Prepare the organization: If NPS is new to the organization, inform the relevant stakeholders and provide training to those who have a direct role in the NPS process.</p>

<p>Sample respondents: Select the respondents to be contacted. Sampling rules can be applied to ensure representation from different segments. There are also predefined sampling rules related to quarantine to avoid contacting customers too often.</p>

<p>Collect feedback: Collect feedback from respondents. Currently, feedback can be collected through telephone or email. Telephone tends to have a higher response rate compared to email.</p>

<p>You are up and running: Utilize the NPS methodology to close the loop for continuous improvements and work towards delivering a better customer experience.</p>

<p>Data for NPS surveying is typically uploaded to the NPS hub. The data should include:</p>

<p>Company hierarchy: The hierarchical structure of the Visma Company, which determines the granularity of reports based on NPS data.</p>

<p>Customer data: Information about customers, such as organization number, purchased products, recurring revenue, and customer classification (high or low revenue).</p>

<p>Stakeholders: Information about the stakeholders at the customer, including email address, telephone number, authority, and position. Contact multiple stakeholders to gather feedback from different perspectives.</p>

<p>Products: A list of products and the customers who have purchased them.</p>

<p>The output data used for NPS surveying includes scores (0-10) and verbatim answers. The scores are used to calculate the Net Promoter Score, while the verbatim answers provide qualitative feedback for improvement.</p>

<p>Quarantine rules are in place to limit the frequency of customer contact. The rules include category exclusion (365 days between sampling to the same category) and date exclusion (180 days between sampling to different categories). Additionally, there are specific exclusion rules for stakeholders based on their sampling history.</p>

<p>Roles involved in the NPS process include NPS Manager, Case Manager, and Watcher. The NPS Manager is responsible for overseeing the NPS process, while the Case Manager is assigned to handle specific cases. Watchers can be added to a case to monitor its progress.</p>

<p>If a respondent gives a score of 0-6 on the likelihood to recommend question, they are categorized as a detractor. Detractors should be contacted within 3 working days for follow-up.</p>
