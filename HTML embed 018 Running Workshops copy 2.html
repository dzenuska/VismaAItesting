<p>Workshops</p>

<p>Why do a workshop?</p>

<p> Workshops are a good way to conduct discovery, kickoff projects, or collaborate with stakeholders and customers. A workshop can efficiently provide both new ways of seeing things and generate lots of new ideas.</p>

<p>It is important to involve all the key stakeholders in these types of workshops allowing everyone to be heard and feel involved in the process and get a common understanding. By inviting participants with different experience and roles, you ensure that the challenge is being addressed from several perspectives, and thereby increase the quantity of the discussions. Customers can also be included, this is especially useful when ideating on how to solve key problems.</p>

<p> Workshops are an opportunity for a team to untangle a problem together by going through a series of group exercises designed to get to a specific outcome. They are about getting things done in groups, and are often used as milestones to start things or make decisions. It takes clear and deliberate planning to run a good workshop. As the organizer, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to ensure everyone&rsquo;s time is spent wisely and you uncover the insights needed to move the project forward.</p>

<p>Steps in running a workshop Identify the purpose of the workshop and what you want to achieve Make sure that you invite all the relevant stakeholders (and customers) from all the departments who can help you with the challenge/problem you want to solve - and send out invitations as early as possible Consider the length of the workshop and whether it should be online or physical. We generally find that several shorter sessions are best for online workshops where it is more difficult to remained focused over longer period of time Create a detailed plan for the workshop, what exercises and activities will you do Make sure that everyone is actively participating in the workshop, use energisers and breaks to keep the engagement up Present key highlights and learnings at the end of the workshop and talk about what the next steps are Summaries the workshop as soon as possible and share with the participants Skip content Running remote workshops</p>

<p> Running an online workshop is slightly different from a physical one. Therefore we've written a blog with some tips on how best to run these types of workshops.</p>

<p>7 tips on how to successfully run remote workshops Published May 22, 2021 inBusinessby Cecilie Campey</p>

<p>Although digital collaboration can be challenging, it can also give exceptional results if done right. Working remotely still allows for creativity and cross-functional collaboration. Over the past weeks, we have run several remote workshops and made up some experiences along the way. In this article, we share our top tips on how to succeed.</p>

<p>Running workshops online might sound a bit chaotic and difficult. However, in our experience, remote workshops are just as productive, fun and valuable as running them in person!</p>

<p>There are many creative digital tools available, such as Mural, that enable participants to visualise, ideate and co-create. You can even use digital post-it notes, but without having to collect and go through them all after the workshop&mdash;one of the benefits of running a remote workshop!</p>

<p>Remote workshop  Factors to consider before the workshop There are a few things you always should consider before running a workshop:</p>

<p>How many people will participate? Consider if it will be best to work as one group with the same challenge or split into groups that work on different challenges and meet to share what they have been working on.</p>

<p>Who should facilitate the workshop? Having two facilitators is beneficial when running remote workshops. One can then lead the discussion and the other can organise the board and help where needed.</p>

<p>Which activities have to be done together? To maximise the time you all have together, think about what activities have to be done in a group and what can be done before or after the workshop. Set up the board in advance and combine work in the workshop with work in between sessions.</p>

<p>How to run a successful workshop remotely Running an interactive and fun workshop is most definitely possible digitally. Here are our top tips to help you get started with successfully running a remote workshop:</p>

<p>1. Ensure that participants are comfortable with the workshop tool: give participants homework to access the tool in advance or run a warm up activity at the start of the workshop.</p>

<p>2. Clearly define expectations, the agenda and desired outcome: clearly state the objectives and expectations of the workshop in order to keep all participants on track. Set a clear agenda with allocated time for each task.</p>

<p>3. Plan several short sessions rather than one long: remote workshops can be experienced as more tiring and demanding, both for facilitators and participants. Split up the sessions, and don&rsquo;t exceed more than two hours per session</p>

<p>4. Make time for breaks during the workshop: even if the session is only two hours long, everyone appreciates being able to stretch or get a drink. This will keep the focus and creativity up for the whole session.</p>

<p>5. Strive to engage all participants: running workshops is primarily about interaction, which can be more challenging remotely. Try to get input from everyone throughout the workshop by addressing participants that are less vocal or alternate who starts presenting.</p>

<p>6. Have a plan B if technology fails: sometimes you have planned everything in detail, only to discover that the technology is failing. Therefore, you should always have a plan B, for example to do the exercise using shared slides.</p>

<p>7. Organise, follow-up and plan the next session: after each workshop, briefly summarise what has been done, what the next steps are, and whether there is homework that needs to be prepared for next session.</p>

<p>Good luck with your remote workshop!</p>
