<p> About to migrate from on-prem to cloud? Follow these steps to keep the customers in mind in the process</p>

<p>What separates migrations from launching new product features or upgrades are many. While many customers eagerly await the migration with anticipation, others may have concerns about changed work routines or loss of historical data. This needs to be dealt with in a manner that reassures the customers that this is the right decision.</p>

<p>Many companies often focus on the technical aspects of the new solution and logistics of the migration itself, forgetting the important communication to their customers that may or may not have wanted this change.</p>

<p>14 steps for a successful migration</p>

<p>To help you better communicate when planning to migrate customers to a new solution, we have listed 14 steps based on the different elements you should take into consideration. The list summarizes the most important aspects based on the experiences we have gathered working with different Visma companies.</p>

<p>To get started, it is important that everyone in the organization working on the migration journey is aware of the customer perspective when it comes to the experience and steps they will need to complete and how the internal tasks fit with that.</p>

<p>The steps:</p>

<p>Step 1: Draft the migration journey Draw a high-level visualization of how the migration process could work from the customer's perspective. Include participants from every relevant part of the value chain for this exercise. The point of visualizing is to get a common understanding of the customer touchpoints that the internal organization agrees upon.</p>

<p>Step 2: Validate functionality Is the functionality similar for the customers? Will the work processes change? This is often a concern. You should evaluate how big of a change it will be for the customers. Create a plan for additional training if this is needed to make the onboarding as pleasant as possible. Learning from this exercise goes into the training process. (Step 6 and 7)</p>

<p>Step 3: Migration of historical data How is this handled? How do we communicate this to the customers? This tends to be one of the most important questions from customers. It is important to have a clear plan for how this will work and what to say to the customers.</p>

<p>Step 4: Milestone plan Set sub-goals for the migration to measure a successful flow from the internal perspective. Examples of metrics to follow can be: Number of migrated customers. Number of support requests related to the migration.</p>

<p>Step 5: Training Plan training for the internal teams &ndash; both directly responsible roles and secondary stakeholders.</p>

<p>Step 6: Training of customers Create relevant training material for the customers. Define if the training will be conducted online or offline.</p>

<p>Step 7: Feedback loop Check feedback loops for technical issues during migration between support, tech teams &amp; customers. If this does not exist in the organization, it must be set up. This is crucial to escalate issues to the appropriate level.</p>

<p>Step 8: Categorize customers Create a list of customers who will be migrated. Sort into groups based on 1) priority, 2) complexity, 3) high risk of churn.</p>

<p>Step 9: Information How do we make sure relevant departments are well informed? Create a plan for knowledge sharing between teams and departments.</p>

<p>Step 10: Support Is the support department ready to support the new solution? This goes hand in hand with training. Also consider staffing up for critical moments of the migration.</p>

<p>Pilot Step 11: Test run Run a pilot on a small number of customers before migrating everyone. Give these customers extra attention to be able to learn.</p>

<p>Step 12: Finalize the migration journey Make necessary adjustments based on feedback from the pilot customers to go live with a crisp and clear migration journey with tasks and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Step 13: Communication plan A solid communication plan is key for a successful migration. The communication should reflect on what the customers can expect when migrating - what's in it for them? How the training will be conducted and where to ask questions or find additional information.</p>

<p>Step 14: Migration Proceed according to the customer priority groups and the plan. All the steps may not be relevant for all migration projects; however, these are elements that should be considered when planning the migration.</p>
