<p>Customer satisfaction surveys (CSAT) are an essential tool for businesses to gather feedback and insights about their performance in various touchpoints with buyers and users of their software and services. These surveys, also known as Transactional Net Promoter Score (tNPS) in Visma, aim to assess customer satisfaction and customer effort in specific transactions. There are two types of surveys commonly used: Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Customer Effort Score (CES).</p>

<p>CSAT surveys focus on measuring customer satisfaction with a particular aspect of the business. The initial question asks, &quot;How satisfied are you with X?&quot; where &quot;X&quot; represents the specific area being evaluated, such as support received or the onboarding process. The response options are typically on a scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to 3, with 1 indicating unsatisfied and 5 indicating satisfied. An open-ended follow-up question is used to gather additional insights and feedback, such as asking the customer to provide reasons for their satisfaction level.</p>

<p>CES surveys, on the other hand, aim to assess the ease of completing a task or action. The initial question asks, &quot;How easy was it for you to complete this task or action?&quot; The scale for CES surveys is usually from 1 to 7, where 1 represents difficult and 7 represents easy. Similar to CSAT surveys, an open-ended question is used to gather further explanations or feedback regarding the customer's response.</p>

<p>It is important to provide customers with the option to provide comments or ideas alongside their ratings to encourage more detailed feedback. However, making the comment optional can help increase response rates by not forcing customers to provide comments if they don't wish to do so.</p>

<p>Customer satisfaction surveys can be used for various types of interactions, including customer support, consultancy, and project deliveries. The frequency of sending these surveys depends on the specific products, customers, and touchpoints. Quarantine rules, which define how often customers are asked for feedback, are often set to once every 30 days for the same contact person or consultant's services.</p>

<p>To ensure a meaningful feedback loop, it is recommended to follow up with customers based on their feedback. Actions should be taken promptly, such as contacting customers who did not receive a callback or reaching out to customers who provided low scores to understand how improvements can be made. The responsible person for following up with customers, known as the case manager, varies depending on the Business Unit's preference and the nature of the service provided.</p>

<p>Visma has established processes for customer satisfaction surveys within its Quality Management System (QMS). These processes cover systematic improvement, survey implementation, CSAT management, and follow-up based on CSAT feedback.</p>

<p>When implementing customer satisfaction surveys, it is crucial to determine the types of customer transactions to collect feedback on and assess how these transactions are currently tracked within the Business Unit. Utilizing existing ticketing systems or support tools may provide an easier integration for survey implementation. Several stand-alone survey tools are available, and it is advisable to consider tools already used by other Visma Business Units. Additionally, integration between Service Cloud and survey tools can automate the transfer of case data for survey purposes.</p>

<p>For NPS managers newly appointed in a Business Unit, understanding the CSAT process and reviewing best practices is crucial. They should also engage with the Customer Experience team to identify the most suitable survey tools and setup based on specific requirements.</p>

<p>In summary, customer satisfaction surveys play a vital role in understanding customer satisfaction and effort in various transactions. By collecting and analyzing feedback, businesses can identify areas for improvement and take necessary actions to enhance their software and services.</p>
