<p>Your product's ultimate mission is to create a specific value for someone, something. That's why &ldquo;Time to Value&rdquo; should be a key metric for customer onboarding. Here are several tips on how you can decrease Time to Value, in a scalable and cost-efficient way. Many companies have already mapped the journey of their customers. There can be many steps in the onboarding phase, depending on customer and product complexity. Here, we will focus on these steps that can be found in most journeys:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 1: Define Day Zero and the desired business outcome for the specific customer segment</p>

<p>Day Zero is the moment when the customer can start getting value from your product that they bought it for. It is also one of the &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments during the journey (they give your customers that kick of positive emotion that will create your fans!).</p>

<p>Day Zero and other Aha! moments will become useful milestones during the onboarding process, helping you define the steps needed to get the customer from one to the other.</p>

<p>The business outcome will help you understand how you need to set up the next steps (product adoption, support, etc.) after onboarding.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Reach out to Product analytics team - they may have some great tips of how you can understand your new users' journey in your product!</p>

<p>Now the onboarding process could look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 2: A pre-configured SaaS environment</p>

<p>Create a &ldquo;pre-configured&rdquo; template (instance) of the SaaS solution with configuration that matches the needs of 80% of customers in the given segment. You could have multiple of these pre-configured instances for different customer segments, giving the user (or the onboarding consultant) a head start.</p>

<p>They will probably still need to transfer data, adjust configuration to their exact needs, etc., however that should take significantly less effort.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 3: Digitise first user training</p>

<p>Define the top 3 (5, 7&#8230;) most common business processes with your product. Record and share with the users short videos explaining how to run them in the product. Use the opportunity to explain the main product features and configuration options.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Boost onboarding with Walkme (contact Ninja Susanne Klausen for feedback) or its alternatives - Appcues, Userlane, etc.. These on-screen guides can lead the user through the product and set everything up the right way.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 4: (for MLE &amp; Public segment) Create common business processes in digital collaboration tools</p>

<p>Digitising a bad process will only make it run faster, potential creating unwanted consequences. Consider mapping and designing the business processes with your customers, and only then digitising them.</p>

<p>To speed up this process, create templates of most common processes using Miro or Lucid Suite (available to Visma group under corporate agreement). Then adjust the process in a workshop together with the customer. The customers will love you for suggesting best practices.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Visma Circle (Netherlands) delivers business process optimisation as a service to their Public segment customers. Contact Edwin Bours if interested how they do it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 5: Automate data migration</p>

<p>If you need to do repeating tasks during onboarding, and can't eliminate them, consider automating them. For example, data migration to your customer's new instance could require inefficient (and boring!) human tasks.</p>

<p>Contact AutoMate team to explore how you can automate the steps.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 6: Continuous user training</p>

<p>Create a modular E-learning course with quizzes. Suggest the e-learning modules to the user when the timing is right to learn the next feature(s).</p>

<p>Use either your existing e-learning platform, or consider one of the solutions in Visma - Talent Solutions (Sweden), Smartskill (Norway) or Plusport (Netherlands).</p>

<p>Pro tip: Create user certification program, ensuring a minimum required level of knowledge, and an element of gamification. Then let the users upload their certificate into LinkedIn and other platforms, improving their portfolio, and showing your brand to their network!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tip 7: Evaluation &amp; Hand-over to Customer Success</p>

<p>Evaluate smaller projects with CSAT surveys. Consider using your existing CRM platform with survey capabilities (e.g., Salesforce, Hubspot, Zendesk, etc. - contact Business Systems team) or one of the dedicated survey tools in Visma - Forsta (contact Julija Kirillova as the expert of the Voice of the Customer framework) or InMoment (contact Paula Kalnina).</p>

<p>Automatically send Welcome email to the customer and users, introducing them to the learning resources and support options. Visma provides tools to automate emails, such as Pardot, Eloqua, and Hubspot (contact Marketing Automation team).</p>

<p>In MLE/Public segment: introduce the customer to their Customer Success Manager either via email or with a short phone call.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To summarise: Being able to do the above steps whilst providing a great experience determines how competitive you are in the market. Remember the formula CS = CX + CO* that solves to growth.</p>
