<p>Customer segmentation</p>

<p>Scientific segmentation of customers and their desired outcomes allows companies to develop and offer the right solutions to the right customers. With our model, you can segment your customers based on their value and needs, discovering the growth potential of each customer.</p>

<p>&quot;Segmentation is a process of dividing the customer base into distinct and internally homogeneous groups in order to develop differentiated strategies according to their characteristics.&quot;</p>

<p>Four steps on how to Segment your customers:</p>

<p>Step 1: Identify data that shows the value of each of your customers. How would you assess the value of the customer to your company? This data will help you see if a) the revenue from the customer matches what you would expect to receive based on their profile and needs, b) you need to prioritize communication or other tasks in regards to the customer. Typical variables to define customer value: Annual Recurring Revenue, Number of products, Customer size, Brand value / advocacy, Growth potential, ... and/or other variables more fitting your business model</p>

<p>Step 2: Identify data that shows the needs of each of your customers. What level of assistance does your customer need to reach their desired outcome? This information will show if the customer has the Success Plan (and product plan if it's sold separately) that will allow them to reach the desired outcome. Typical variables to define customer needs: Required level of assistance, Number of users, Product competence or adoption, Consultancy needs, Number of touchpoints, ... and/or other variables more fitting your business model</p>

<p>Step 3: Identify data that helps assess the growth potential of each of your customers. Does the data about customer needs (see Step 2) indicate that they would be willing to purchase more product features or services? Does the customer need a specific Success Plan that addresses their needs of assistance? Typical variables to define customer growth potential: CSAT or NPS score, Customer Health Score, Assessment from Business Review, Budget for additional purchases, ... and/or other variables more fitting your business model</p>

<p>Step 4: Determine each customer's segment and develop suitable strategies to maximize customer value. Typical use cases to develop matching offerings for each segment include: Design onboarding and communication plans Define Day Zero &amp; Desired Outcomes of each segment (helps you develop the offerings further!) Design product packages and Success Plans Analyze customer feedback or NPS scores Assign Customer Success Managers Plan events and marketing activities</p>
